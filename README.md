# Industrial hazard prediction
Predicting industrial hazards using semantic similarity

This project is a proof of concept for OSHA to predict potentially dangerous incidents that could occour in industrial plants and alert floor managers on potential risks.

Using previously reported fatality/hazard reports (https://www.osha.gov/fatalities/reports/archive), we analyze new incident reports using semantic similarity and alert the floor managers if an non-fatal incident could potentially be risky.
